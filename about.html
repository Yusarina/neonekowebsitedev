                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>Neoneko is a team dedicated to creating high-quality, modern plugins for Blender and potentially other software in the future. Our aim is to ensure that all team members have an equal voice and to prevent power concentration in the hands of a single individual. Currently, we maintain the Unofficial version of the Cats Blender Plugin and are developing a new Blender plugin called Avatar Toolkit, which is intended to replace Cats.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Our Origins</h2>
                <p>Neoneko was formed shortly after Yusarina, who was the original person maintaining the Unofficial Cats Blender Plugin, started to think, "Wait, what would happen if I disappeared for some reason?" She realized Cats would yet again be left to rot, causing more confusion among users. Although she has zero plans to just vanish, well, life can happen. So she decided it would be a good idea to make sure more than one person can continue to maintain Cats and other software she might maintain or create, while still having access to the official repos and stuff. That's why Neoneko was formed.</p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h2>Our Values</h2>
                <p>Neoneko was also formed because Rina (Yusarina) believes that not just one person should have the decision power on what to do, and that all team members should get equal shares of any kind of donations from users. However, we understand sometimes executive decisions may need to be made, which is why Rina, at least for the time being is the Project Lead.</p>

                <h2>Our Team</h2>
                <p>Currently, Neoneko has two team members:</p>
